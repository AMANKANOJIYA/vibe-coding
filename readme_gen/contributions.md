# 🤝 Vibe Coding Contributions Guide

Welcome to the official **Vibe Coding** repository — a collaborative coding space where we come together to solve simple but meaningful problems for the community. Whether it's a tool to save time, a quirky idea that helps a friend, or an automation that makes life easier — if it solves something, it's welcome here.

---

## 🧩 What Is This?

This repo is a collection of **mini-projects** built live during the **Vibe Coding Event** with ~80–100 passionate developers. Each of us picked a problem and tried to solve it creatively. All projects live side by side, documented, and open to the world.

## 🗂 Folder Structure

Each project must have its **own folder** in the root of this repo. Here's the structure to follow:

```

/vibe-coding-repo
│
├── project-name/
│   ├── README.md
│   ├── code/
│   └── assets/ (optional)
│
├── another-project/
│   ├── README.md
│   ├── code/
│   └── assets/
│
└── contributions.md

```

### 📛 Folder Naming Convention

- Use **kebab-case** for folder names.
- Keep names short, descriptive, and unique.
- Examples: `habit-tracker`, `ai-resume-helper`, `water-reminder-bot`
